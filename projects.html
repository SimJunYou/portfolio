            <div class="CardTitle">Portfolio Website</div>
            My first attempt at a portfolio website was made with React, with a
            super minimal backend in Koa (which I later I realised I didn't need
            for a static site). There was lots of Bootstrap involved for stuff
            that I didn't realise I could do with simple CSS too. I added nice
            animations with react-spring and react-reveal. But as I worked, I
            realised that the whole website was pretty bloated by a single-page
            static site standard.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm not really a HTML/CSS purist, but I prefer to avoid using libraries where
            I can to stay as close to barebones as possible. Also, I actually jumped straight into React/Koa without
            much
            practice in the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I read some tutorials
            and found that I could be making the same website with no frameworks
            or JS libraries whatsoever.
            <br />
            <br />
            What you're seeing now is my pure HTML/CSS/JS website with no
            extraneous libraries or frameworks. I know it's not the prettiest
            and I'm not sure if I've followed best practice, but it's been great
            practice for HTML/CSS fundamentals and beyond.

            After learning Python, I got hooked on making Telegram bots. The
            first few I made were for simple stuff like downloading Youtube
            videos and keeping todo lists, but as I got more comfortable with
            the API I started trying more complicated projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is the bot that I use the most in my day-to-day life. It
            provides me with finance/investment related tweets from a select
            group of investment-related Twitter users. It provides a live feed
            in whatever group it is started in, and there are some commands to
            do some specific tweet scrapes, like for stock recommendations and
            so on.
            <br />
            <br />
            The bot is hosted on Heroku with a hobby dyno so it runs
            permanently, so it just feeds me and my friends with sketchy
            investment advice every now and then. This was an interesting
            project involving the Twitter API which I'd never used before and
            also a foray into the multitasking aspect of Python (using the
            threading library).

            <div class="CardTitle">Alex</div>
            Alex is a LIDAR enabled remote controlled car. Whatever the LIDAR
            sees is transmitted back to the remote controller and mapped. There
            are a 3 machines involved: The Raspberry Pi, the Arduino, and the
            client's computer.

            This one's a school project, but I'm pretty proud of how my group
            put it together. This was my first venture into combining different
            programs across different machines into one cohesive and fluid user
            experience. I learned a lot about shell scripting in the process. I
            can't claim that it was entirely my work, but I did write all the
            shell scripts that you see in the video.
            <br />
            <br />
            I would say this was the project that pushed me to try more
            complicated projects like those you see above as well as some other
            multi-machine/API projects. I'm definitely going to continue
            pursuing similar projects in the future - possibly Smart Home IOT
            related?

            <div class="CardTitle">ra.VI</div>
            ra.VI (Repository Assistant with a Versatile Interface) is another
            school project from a software engineering module. It's a CLI
            personal assistant written in Java designed to help students manage
            tasks, todos, and their timetable faster than traditional GUI apps.
            <br />
            <br />
            This was my first real large-scale project with a group of people,
            and it was a rough journey. I learned about version control,
            continuous integration, code style enforcement, unit and integration
            testing, and user and developer documentation.
            <br />
            <br />
            The programming side of this project is nothing to write home about.
            (It was actually pretty buggy even at the final release.) However,
            now I can confidently say that I have a basic grasp of the general
            workflow of a software engineering team, and that I can manage
            myself in such an environment.
