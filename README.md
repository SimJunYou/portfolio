# My Portfolio Site
## _Version 2_

A simple static site made in pure HTML/CSS/JS, hosted on Netlify. Very orange! See it live [here](http://simjunyou.netlify.app).

## Details

I actually made the very first version in React with Bootstrap and a bunch of other bells and whistles. It was getting too bloated for a single-page static website, and I actually didn't really learn much about HTML and CSS while doing it.So instead, I decided to scrap the entire thing and instead go ahead with using pure HTML and CSS for the website.

Using pure HTML and CSS really forced me to learn about their finer workings, and I learned JavaScript for some additional things like scroll detection and transitions when elements come into view. While it may not be as fancy as a React app could be, I'm still proud of it. 

## Building

If you want to run this site yourself (for some reason), good news! You don't need anything to run it because it's just a single HTML file with a single CSS sheet and a single JavaScript file. You can just open it in your browser of choice and it'll work fine. Smooth scrolling doesn't work on Safari, though.

I actually spent a good amount of time thinking I needed a build tool (I was using Nodemon, then I moved to Parcel) until I realised that I could just open up the HTML file and it'll be as good as live. Glad I found out at some point, at least.
