          <b>Welcome! I'm Jun You, a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at
            NUS.</b>
          I built this website from scratch to learn more about web
          development. It's a static site made using pure HTML, CSS, and a
          little JavaScript. This is the second iteration of this site, after
          I made the first one with React, Bootstrap, and Koa. It has some
          rudimentary responsive design, so it should read well on phones too.
          I'm not really aiming to be a web developer.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>I like to learn stuff and apply them.</b> I've learned Python, C,
          C++, Java, and JavaScript so far, but I mainly use Python. I am
          proficient at Pandas, SQL, VBA, and Excel/Power BI's Power Query. I
          read documentation and Google is my best friend. I know my way
          around the command line. I use Linux (Manjaro) sometimes. I may not
          have any experience in professional software engineering, but I
          understand the general workflow from version control to code
          reviews.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>I like to write and build things that make my life easier.</b>
          I've built a smart mirror with a Raspberry Pi and an old TV, wrote a
          Telegram + Twitter bot to fetch me tweets from trading experts, and
          automated tons of work on Excel with Python, VBA, and Power Query. I
          try not to spend more time automating things than actually doing
          them.

          <div class="CardTitle">Portfolio Website</div>
          My first attempt at a portfolio website was made with React, with a
          super minimal backend in Koa (which I later I realised I didn't need
          for a static site). There was lots of Bootstrap involved for stuff
          that I didn't realise I could do with simple CSS too. I added nice
          animations with react-spring and react-reveal. But as I worked, I
          realised that the whole website was pretty bloated by a single-page
          static site standard.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm not really a HTML/CSS purist, but I prefer to avoid using libraries where
          I can to stay as close to barebones as possible. Also, I actually jumped straight into React/Koa without much
          practice in the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I read some tutorials
          and found that I could be making the same website with no frameworks
          or JS libraries whatsoever.
          <br />
          <br />
          What you're seeing now is my pure HTML/CSS/JS website with no
          extraneous libraries or frameworks. I know it's not the prettiest
          and I'm not sure if I've followed best practice, but it's been great
          practice for HTML/CSS fundamentals and beyond.

        <div class="CardText">
          <div class="CardTitle">WallStweetBot</div>
          After learning Python, I got hooked on making Telegram bots. The
          first few I made were for simple stuff like downloading Youtube
          videos and keeping todo lists, but as I got more comfortable with
          the API I started trying more complicated projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is the bot that I use the most in my day-to-day life. It
          provides me with finance/investment related tweets from a select
          group of investment-related Twitter users. It provides a live feed
          in whatever group it is started in, and there are some commands to
          do some specific tweet scrapes, like for stock recommendations and
          so on.
          <br />
          <br />
          The bot is hosted on Heroku with a hobby dyno so it runs
          permanently, so it just feeds me and my friends with sketchy
          investment advice every now and then. This was an interesting
          project involving the Twitter API which I'd never used before and
          also a foray into the multitasking aspect of Python (using the
          threading library).

          <div class="CardTitle">Alex</div>
          Alex is a LIDAR enabled remote controlled car. Whatever the LIDAR
          sees is transmitted back to the remote controller and mapped. There
          are a 3 machines involved: The Raspberry Pi, the Arduino, and the
          client's computer.

          <br />
          This one's a school project, but I'm pretty proud of how my group
          put it together. This was my first venture into combining different
          programs across different machines into one cohesive and fluid user
          experience. I learned a lot about shell scripting in the process. I
          can't claim that it was entirely my work, but I did write all the
          shell scripts that you see in the video.
          <br />
          <br />
          I would say this was the project that pushed me to try more
          complicated projects like those you see above as well as some other
          multi-machine/API projects. I'm definitely going to continue
          pursuing similar projects in the future - possibly Smart Home IOT
          related?

          <div class="CardTitle">ra.VI</div>
          ra.VI (Repository Assistant with a Versatile Interface) is another
          school project from a software engineering module. It's a CLI
          personal assistant written in Java designed to help students manage
          tasks, todos, and their timetable faster than traditional GUI apps.
          <br />
          <br />
          This was my first real large-scale project with a group of people,
          and it was a rough journey. I learned about version control,
          continuous integration, code style enforcement, unit and integration
          testing, and user and developer documentation.
          <br />
          <br />
          The programming side of this project is nothing to write home about.
          (It was actually pretty buggy even at the final release.) However,
          now I can confidently say that I have a basic grasp of the general
          workflow of a software engineering team, and that I can manage
          myself in such an environment.
