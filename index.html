        <br />
        <br />
        I built this website from scratch to learn more about web development.
        It's a static site made using pure HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.
        This is actually the second iteration of the site, after my first
        attempt in React and Bootstrap. It's been a lot more fun than I
        initially thought it would be!
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>I like to learn stuff and apply them.</strong> I've learned
        <b>Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript</b> so far, but I mainly use
        Python. I am proficient at
        <b>Pandas, SQL, VBA, and Excel/Power BI's Power Query</b>. When I don't
        know things, I read documentation and I Google a lot. I know my way
        around the command line and have experience using Linux. I may not have
        any experience in professional software engineering, but I understand
        the general workflow from version control to code reviews.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong
          >I like to write and build things that make my life easier.</strong
        >
        I've built a smart mirror with a <b>Raspberry Pi</b> and an old TV,
        wrote a <b>Telegram + Twitter bot</b> to fetch me tweets from trading
        experts, and automated tons of work on Excel with
        <b>Python, VBA, and Power Query</b>. I try not to spend more time
        automating things than actually doing them.

        far. This isn't in order of proficiency, but rather what I tend to use
        each one for and how often I use them.

        I was assigned to create a pure Excel workbook that would process large
        amounts of raw data and turn it into readable sheets and graphs which we
        could then extract insights from. No Python or external programs.
        <br />
        <br />
        I quickly picked up <b>Power Query and the M language</b>, and put
        together this Excel workbook. It took in user input and configurations
        as tables in the sheet, which Power Query read and combined together
        with the raw data inflow to filter and transform it into exactly what
        the user wants. Not exactly professional data engineering, but it was
        fun regardless.

        WallStweetBot is a <b>Telegram bot</b> that provides a live feed of
        selected Twitter accounts' feeds in whatever group it is started in, and
        there are some commands to do some specific tweet scrapes, like for
        stock recommendations and so on. It's pretty barebones, since there's
        basically no user configuration (because I intended it for personal
        use).
        <br />
        <br />
        The bot is hosted on Heroku with a hobby dyno so it runs permanently, so
        it just feeds me and my friends with sketchy investment advice every now
        and then. This was an interesting project involving the Twitter API
        which I'd never used before and also a foray into the multitasking
        aspect of Python (using the threading library).

        <h1>Alex</h1>
        <div class="project-img-container">
          <img class="project-img" src="public/alex.png" />

        Alex is a LIDAR enabled remote controlled car. Whatever the LIDAR sees
        is transmitted back to the client via the Raspberry Pi and mapped. There
        are 3 machines involved: The Raspberry Pi, the Arduino, and the client's
        computer.
        <br />
        <br />
        This one's a school project, but I'm pretty proud of how my group put it
        together. This was my first venture into combining different programs
        across different machines into one cohesive and fluid user experience. I
        learned a lot about <b>the command line and shell scripting </b>in the
        process. I can't claim that it was entirely my work, but I did write all
        the shell scripts that you see in the video.

        <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
        <div class="project-img-container">
          <img class="project-img" src="public/website.jpg" />
          <span class="project-img-subtitle"
            >Fig. 4: The wireframe of this website's first version!
          </span>
        </div>
        My first attempt at a portfolio website was made with React, with a
        super minimal backend in Koa (which I later I realised I didn't need for
        a static site). There was lots of Bootstrap involved for stuff that I
        didn't realise I could do with simple CSS too. But as I worked, I
        realised that the whole website was pretty bloated by a single-page
        static site standard.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm not really a HTML/CSS purist, but I prefer to avoid using libraries
        where I can to stay as close to barebones as possible. After some
        research, I basically just dove into making a pure HTML/CSS site to go
        back to the basics.
        <br />
        <br />
        What you're seeing now is the
        <b
          >second iteration of a pure HTML/CSS/JS website with no extraneous
          libraries or frameworks</b
        >. I know it's not the prettiest and I'm not sure if I've followed best
        practice, but it's been great practice for HTML/CSS fundamentals and
        beyond.
